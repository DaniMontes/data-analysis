# Data Quality Report

## Challenge: Spotify API

### Introduction


A Python project was created in GitHub Codespaces and Visual Studio Code web client adding and modifying a predefined DevContainer configuration with Dockerfile. Python 3 was used as programming language with the following libraries/frameworks: Panda, Json, and Flask.

The JSON file extracted from the Spotify API (taylor_swift_spotify.json) is loaded and processed through a web application (app.py and dataTransformation.py), which also allows downloading the generated CSV file on the server. The Python script for data exploration is called “dataAnalysis.py”, which must be executed in a Python terminal to view the results of the functions, which are detailed in the following report with its respective screenshot.
